🖼️ AltSense: The AI Alt-Text Generator for Scale and ComplianceAltSense is a professional, AI-powered platform designed to generate WCAG 2.2 compliant and SEO-optimized image alt-text at any scale. We solve the critical, non-scalable problem of manual alt-text writing, helping e-commerce managers, content teams, and web agencies achieve 100% accessibility compliance and boost image search ranking automatically.✨ Why AltSense? (The Value Proposition)Manual alt-text is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone. AltSense delivers a reliable, high-quality solution built on Google's most advanced Vision models.⚡ Built for Scale: Our Server-Side Queuing Architecture (using Supabase Edge Functions) guarantees reliable processing of large image batches (1,000s of images) without timing out, failing, or hitting external API rate limits.🧠 Niche Profile Generation: We use a two-step AI refinement process. The first step generates a detailed description, and the second step refines it based on a chosen industry profile (e.g., E-commerce SEO, Art Curator, Technical Manuals) to ensure the alt-text contains the exact keywords and context needed.🛡️ Compliance First: Every generated alt-text is optimized to meet the criteria of WCAG 2.2, ensuring your images are accessible to screen reader users and protecting your business from legal risks.📈 E-commerce Focused: Seamlessly integrate alt-text generation into your product catalog workflow, ensuring every product image is search-engine ready and conversion-optimized.🛠️ Technology Stack (How It Works)AltSense is designed for speed, resilience, and horizontal scaling.ComponentTechnologyRole in AltSenseFrontend/APINext.js (Vercel)Handles the user interface, routing, and serverless API endpoints for job submission and payment processing.AI Vision ModelGoogle Gemini APIUsed in a two-step call (gemini-2.5-pro for deep analysis, gemini-2.5-flash for refined text generation).Database & AuthSupabaseProvides PostgreSQL database for user credits, job queues, and Realtime subscriptions for instant job status updates in the dashboard.Queue/WorkerSupabase Edge FunctionsDedicated background worker that processes one job at a time, managing the rate limit for the Gemini API call and ensuring the system never crashes under load.StorageSupabase StorageSecure, temporary storage for user images during the processing lifecycle.
